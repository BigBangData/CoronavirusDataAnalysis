This is a simple exploration of the time series data which was compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) from various sources (see website for full description). The data can be downloaded manually at [Novel Coronavirus 2019 Cases.](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases)This [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BigBangData/CoronavirusDataAnalysis) hosts all files for this project, including all previous versions. For full reproducibility, a similar directory structure including custom datasets should be reproduced as well - the easiest way would be to clone directly from GitHub.

This project is not intended to be a serious data analysis, which would require more datasets and study. This is a personal project to explore the daily JHU datasets. The plots produced here, therefore, have serious issues and do not reflect reality. They do not take into consideration the meaning of confirmed cases - this varies per location and time depending on differing methods of definition, availability of testing, changes in policy, and so forth. These plots should not be taken as a model for how COVID-19 spreads through populations. The data is incomplete, and represents a view of the past.

## Data Pre-Processing {#preprocess-link}

I downloaded three CSV files, one for each status: confirmed cases, fatal cases, and recovered cases. The confirmed status is a sum of all confirmed cases which later turn into fatalities or recoveries, so I subtracted those to get a fourth status of "active" cases. I produce a longform dataset with the following structure:






```r
# structure of dataset
str(dfm)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	182736 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ Country: chr  "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" ...
##  $ Status : Factor w/ 4 levels "Confirmed","Fatal",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ Date   : Date, format: "2020-09-20" "2020-09-19" ...
##  $ Count  : int  39044 38919 38883 38872 38855 38815 38772 38716 38641 38606 ...
```


There are 182736 rows and 4 columns. Each single-status dataset is as long as the number of days times the number of countries for the data in a given day. Today there are 243 daysa and 188 countries in the data. 

In pre-processing I decided to remove the sub-national province or state variable because it is too sparse and varies too much per day. For this project I am concentrating on country-level data. I also discarded latitude and longitude since there are many issues with those, and I do not plan on mapping the spread of the disease.


The top and bottom rows for the final dataset look thus:

## Data Wrangling and Enrichment {#enrich-link}


I maintain a static dataset of countries and their populations. This data is cobbled together with internet searches and the [World Health Organization data.](https://apps.who.int/gho/data/view.main.POP2040ALL?lang=en) I use the country's population to calculate a `Pct` column with the percentage of cases given a country and a status. I also calculate the difference between each day and the previous day's counts as the `NewCases` variable.








The top rows of the enriched dataset for Brazil and Canada are:

<table class="table table-striped table-hover table-condensed" style="width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">

## Exploratory Data Analysis {#eda-link}




#### WORLD TOTALS

In this first section I plot a series of barplots for the top ten countries per status (confirmed, fatal, recovered, active) by count, percentage of population, and number of new cases since the previous day.

UPDATE - decided to remove Active plots, in fact, this whole section is badly plotted, it leads to information overload. 
TO DO - find 1 or 2 plots to convey the same information, or the message behind it (stacked barplots a maybe).

### Interactive Time Series Plots - Fatal and Active cases

With 4 statuses (confirmed, fatal, recovered, and active cases), 3 types of plots (count, percentage, and new cases), and 2 scales (linear and log), we have about 24 types of plots to consider. To make sense of data in a 2D plot that fits a computer screen, the human eye needs it to be more-or-less of the same scale, so countries with huge disparities would not be able to be easily compared. Moreover, we can only choose about 5 countries per plot before it gets too busy. I could choose the top five countries and plot all 24 plots, but that leads to information overload. 

I this section I plot the top five countries for active and fatal cases. Fatal is the most relible type of data since there are more protocols involving deaths than confirmation of a virus, and active is a mildly useful way to track how many cases are out there based on this dataset. 


UPDATE - same issue as barplots, information overload. Find better ways to plot (ex: plot count + log in dual axis plot).

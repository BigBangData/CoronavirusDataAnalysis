This is a simple exploration of the time series data which was compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) from various sources (see website for full description). The data can be downloaded manually at [Novel Coronavirus 2019 Cases.](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases)

## Data Pre-Processing {#preprocess-link}

The `preprocess` function creates a local folder and pulls three csv files, one for each stage in tracking the coronavirus spread (confirmed, fatal, and recovered cases), performs various pre-processing steps to create one narrow and long dataset, saving it in compressed RDS format. See code in the [Code Appendix.](#codeappendix-link)




```r
# read in RDS file 
dfm <- preprocess()
str(dfm)
```

```
## 'data.frame':	48378 obs. of  7 variables:
##  $ Province_State: chr  NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ Country_Region: chr  "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" "Afghanistan" ...
##  $ Lat           : num  33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 33 ...
##  $ Long          : num  65 65 65 65 65 65 65 65 65 65 ...
##  $ Date          : Date, format: "2020-03-27" "2020-03-26" ...
##  $ Value         : int  110 94 84 74 40 40 24 24 22 22 ...
##  $ Status        : Factor w/ 3 levels "confirmed","fatal",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```


There are 48378 rows and 7 columns. There's a 'Status' column for the different stages, so the number of rows is 3 times the number of rows for a single status (ex. "confirmed"). Each single-status dataset is as long as the number of days in the time series (for a given day the data is pulled) times the number of countries and sub-national provinces or states. This number varies per country, and also varies per day depending on how the dataset is built.

## Data Cleanup  {#cleanup-link}


### Location Granularity 

The data's location variables have several issues. The `Country_Region` variable represents a larger area while the `Province_State` represents more granular areas. There are a few countries which include the subnational provinces or states, and others that do not. In the US, the granularity sometimes arrives at county level (Mar 27 UPDATE: this has not been true in recent days.)

All these differences represent a problem when grouping by a certain area. This can be visualized in [Johns Hopkins' dashboard](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html): the totals for fatalities are grouped by a mixture of countries and sub-national geographic areas. The US is conspicuously missing. I will delve into subnational data at another time, so I recreated the dataset at the national level (see [Code Appendix](#codeappendix-link) for details).

### Time Series Plots per Status and Location

This interactive time series speaks for itself: the US has overtaken Italy and China in number of confirmed cases in the last two days.

# Coronavirus Data Analysis

This is a simple exploration of the time series data which was compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) from various sources (see the website) and can be direcly accessed at [Novel Coronavirus 2019 Cases.](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-cases)

This project is not intended to be a serious data analysis, which would require more datasets and study. This is a personal project to explore the daily JHU datasets. The plots produced here, therefore, have serious issues and do not reflect reality. They do not take into consideration the meaning of confirmed cases - this varies per location and time depending on differing methods of definition, availability of testing, changes in policy, and so forth. These plots should not be taken as a model for how COVID-19 spreads through populations. The data is incomplete, and represents a view of the past.
